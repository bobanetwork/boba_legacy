## Abstract

An account abstraction proposal which completely avoids the need for consensus-layer protocol changes. Instead of adding new protocol features and changing the bottom-layer transaction type, this proposal instead introduces a higher-layer pseudo-transaction object called a `UserOperation`. Users send `UserOperation` objects into a separate mempool. A special class of actor called bundlers (either miners, or users that can send transactions to miners through a bundle marketplace) package up a set of these objects into a transaction making a `handleOps` call to a special contract, and that transaction then gets included in a block.

## Motivation

See also ["Implementing Account Abstraction as Part of Eth 1.x"](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/implementing-account-abstraction-as-part-of-eth1-x/4020) and the links therein for historical work and motivation, and [EIP-2938](./eip-2938.md) for a consensus layer proposal for implementing the same goal.

This proposal takes a different approach, avoiding any adjustments to the consensus layer. It seeks to achieve the following goals:

* **Achieve the key goal of account abstraction**: allow users to use smart contract wallets containing arbitrary verification logic instead of EOAs as their primary account. Completely remove any need at all for users to also have EOAs (as status quo SC wallets and EIP-3074 both require)
* **Decentralization**
    * Allow any bundler (think: miner) to participate in the process of including account-abstracted user operations
    * Work with all activity happening over a public mempool; users do not need to know the direct communication addresses (eg. IP, onion) of any specific actors
    * Avoid trust assumptions on bundlers
* **Do not require any Ethereum consensus changes**: Ethereum consensus layer development is focusing on the merge and later on scalability-oriented features, and there may not be any opportunity for further protocol changes for a long time. Hence, to increase the chance of faster adoption, this proposal avoids Ethereum consensus changes.
* **Try to support other use cases**
    * Privacy-preserving applications
    * Atomic multi-operations (similar goal to EIP-3074)
    * Pay tx fees with ERC-20 tokens, allow developers to pay fees for their users, and [EIP-3074](./eip-3074.md)-like **sponsored transaction** use cases more generally
    * Support aggregated signature (e.g. BLS)

## Definitions

* **UserOperation** - a structure that describes a transaction to be sent on behalf of a user. To avoid confusion, it is named "transaction".
  * Like a transaction, it contains "sender", "to", "calldata", "maxFeePerGas", "maxPriorityFee", "signature", "nonce"
  * unlike transaction, it contains several other fields, desribed below
  * also, the "nonce" and "signature" fields usage is not defined by the protocol, but by each account implementation
* **Sender** - the account contract sending a user operation.
* **EntryPoint** - a singleton contract to execute bundles of UserOperations. Bundlers/Clients whitelist the supported entrypoint.
* **Bundler** - a node (block builder) that bundles multiple UserOperations and create an EntryPoint.handleOps() transaction.
* **Aggregator** - a helper contract trusted by wallets to validate an aggregated signature. Bundlers/Clients whitelist the supported aggregators.

## Specification

To avoid Ethereum consensus changes, we do not attempt to create new transaction types for account-abstracted transactions. Instead, users package up the action they want their wallet to take in an ABI-encoded struct called a `UserOperation`:

| Field | Type | Description
| - | - | - |
| `sender` | `address` | The wallet making the operation |
| `nonce` | `uint256` | Anti-replay parameter; also used as the salt for first-time wallet creation |
| `initCode` | `bytes` | The initCode of the wallet (needed if and only if the wallet is not yet on-chain and needs to be created) |
| `callData` | `bytes` | The data to pass to the `sender` during the main execution call |
| `callGasLimit` | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate the main execution call |
| `verificationGasLimit` | `uint256` | The amount of gas to allocate for the verification step |
| `preVerificationGas` | `uint256` | The amount of gas to pay for to compensate the bundler for pre-verification execution and calldata |
| `maxFeePerGas` | `uint256` | Maximum fee per gas (similar to EIP 1559 `max_fee_per_gas`) |
| `maxPriorityFeePerGas` | `uint256` | Maximum priority fee per gas (similar to EIP 1559 `max_priority_fee_per_gas`) |
| `paymasterAndData` | `bytes` | Address of paymaster sponsoring the transaction, followed by extra data to send to the paymaster (empty for self-sponsored transaction) |
| `signature` | `bytes` | Data passed into the wallet along with the nonce during the verification step |

Users send `UserOperation` objects to a dedicated user operation mempool. A specialized class of actors called **bundlers** (either miners running special-purpose code, or users that can relay transactions to miners eg. through a bundle marketplace such as Flashbots that can guarantee next-block-or-never inclusion) listen in on the user operation mempool, and create **bundle transactions**. A bundle transaction packages up multiple `UserOperation` objects into a single `handleOps` call to a pre-published global **entry point contract**.

To prevent replay attacks (both cross-chain and multiple `EntryPoint` implementations), the `signature` should depend on `chainid` and the `EntryPoint` address.

The core interface of the entry point contract is as follows:

```c++
function handleOps(UserOperation[] calldata ops, address payable beneficiary);

function handleAggregatedOps(
    UserOpsPerAggregator[] calldata opsPerAggregator,
    address payable beneficiary
);

struct UserOpsPerAggregator {
    UserOperation[] userOps;
    IAggregator aggregator;
    bytes signature;
}

function simulateValidation(UserOperation calldata userOp);
    
error SimulationResult(uint256 preOpGas, uint256 prefund, uint256 deadline, PaymasterInfo paymasterInfo);

error SimulationResultWithAggregation(uint256 preOpGas, uint256 prefund, uint256 deadline, PaymasterInfo paymasterInfo, AggregationInfo aggregationInfo);

struct PaymasterInfo {
    uint256 paymasterStake;
    uint256 paymasterUnstakeDelay;
}

struct AggregationInfo {
    address actualAggregator;
    uint256 aggregatorStake;
    uint256 aggregatorUnstakeDelay;
}
```

The core interface required for a wallet to have is:

```solidity
interface IWallet {
  function validateUserOp
      (UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 requestId, address aggregator, uint256 missingWalletFunds)
      external returns (uint256 deadline);
}
```
The wallet
* MUST validate the caller is a trusted EntryPoint
* The requestId is a hash over the userOp (except signature), entryPoint and chainId
* If the wallet does not support signature aggregation, it MUST validate the signature is a valid signature of the `requestId` 
* MUST pay the entryPoint (caller) at least the "missingWalletFunds" (which might be zero, in case current wallet's deposit is high enough)
* The wallet MAY pay more than this minimum, to cover future transactions (it can always issue `withdrawTo` to retrieve it)
* The `aggregator` SHOULD be ignored for wallets that don't use an aggregator
* The return value `deadline` is either zero (meaning "indefinitely"), or the last timestamp this request is deemed valid.

A Wallet that works with aggregated signature should have the interface:
```solidity
interface IAggregatedWallet is IWallet {

  function getAggregator() view returns (address);
}
```
* **getAggregator()** returns the aggregator this wallet supports.
* **validateUserOp()** (inherited from IWallet interface) MUST verify the `aggregator` parameter is valid and the same as `getAggregator`
* The wallet should also support aggregator-specific getter (e.g. `getAggregationInfo()`).
  This method should export the wallet's public-key to the aggregator, and possibly more info
  (note that it is not called directly by the entryPoint) 
* validateUserOp MAY ignore the signature field

The core interface required by an aggregator is:
```solidity
interface IAggregator {

  function validateUserOpSignature(UserOperation calldata userOp)
  external view returns (bytes memory sigForUserOp);

  function aggregateSignatures(UserOperation[] calldata userOps) external view returns (bytes memory aggregatesSignature);

  function validateSignatures(UserOperation[] calldata userOps, bytes calldata signature) view external;
}
```

* If a wallet uses an aggregator (returns it with getAggregator()), then its address is returned by `simulateValidation()` reverting with `SimulationResultWithAggregator` instead of `SimulationResult`
* To accept the UserOp, the bundler must call **validateUserOpSignature()** to validate the userOp's signature.
* **aggregateSignatures()** must aggregate all UserOp signature into a single value.  
* Note that the above methods are helper method for the bundler. The bundler MAY use a native library to perform the same validation and aggregation logic.
* **validateSignatures()** MUST validate the aggregated signature matches for all UserOperations in the array, and revert otherwise.
  This method is called on-chain by `handleOps()`

#### Using signature aggregators

A wallet signify it uses signature aggregation by exposing the aggregator's address in the `getAggregator()` method.
During `simulateValidation`, this aggregator is returned (in the `SimulationResultWithAggregator`) 

The bundler should first accept the validator (validate its stake info and that it is not throttled/banned)
Then it MUST verify the userOp using `aggregator.validateUserOpSignature()`

Signature aggregator SHOULD stake just like a paymaster. Bundlers MAY throttle down and ban aggregators in case they take too much 
resources (or revert) when the above methods are called in view mode, or if the signature aggregation fails 

### Required entry point contract functionality

There are 2 separate entry point methods: `handleOps` and `handleAggregatedOps`
* `handleOps` handle userOps of wallets that don't require any signature aggregator.
* `handleAggregatedOps` can handle a batch that contains userOps of multiple aggregators (and also requests without any aggregator)
* `handleAggregatedOps` performs the same logic below as `handleOps`, but it must transfer the correct aggregator to each userOp, and also must call `validateSignatures` on each aggregator after doing all the per-wallet validation.
The entry point's `handleOps` function must perform the following steps (we first describe the simpler non-paymaster case). It must make two loops, the **verification loop** and the **execution loop**. In the verification loop, the `handleOps` call must perform the following steps for each `UserOperation`:

* **Create the wallet if it does not yet exist**, using the initcode provided in the `UserOperation`. If the wallet does not exist, _and_ the initcode is empty, or does not deploy a contract at the "sender" address, the call must fail.
* **Call `validateUserOp` on the wallet**, passing in the `UserOperation`, the required fee and aggregator (if there is one). The wallet should verify the operation's signature, and pay the fee if the wallet considers the operation valid. If any `validateUserOp` call fails, `handleOps` must skip execution of at least that operation, and may revert entirely.
* Validate the wallet's deposit in the entryPoint is high enough to cover the max possible cost (cover the already-done verification and max execution gas)

In the execution loop, the `handleOps` call must perform the following steps for each `UserOperation`:

* **Call the wallet with the `UserOperation`'s calldata**. It's up to the wallet to choose how to parse the calldata; an expected workflow is for the wallet to have an `execute` function that parses the remaining calldata as a series of one or more calls that the wallet should make.

![](../assets/eip-4337/image1.png)

Before accepting a `UserOperation`, bundlers should use an RPC method to locally call the `simulateValidation` function of the entry point, to verify that the signature is correct and the operation actually pays fees; see the [Simulation section below](#simulation) for details.
A node/bundler SHOULD drop (and not add to the mempool) `UserOperation` that fails the validation

### Extension: paymasters

We extend the entry point logic to support **paymasters** that can sponsor transactions for other users. This feature can be used to allow application developers to subsidize fees for their users, allow users to pay fees with ERC-20 tokens and many other use cases. When the paymaster is not equal to the zero address, the entry point implements a different flow:

![](../assets/eip-4337/image2.png)

First, a paymaster must issue `addStake()` to lock some eth for a period of time. Note that the amount staked (and unstake delay time) are not defined on-chain, and MUST be
validated by nodes during the UserOperation validation phase. The staked value should be above PAYMASTER_STAKE_VALUE and delay above PAYMASTER_MIN_UNSTAKE_DELAY seconds.
During the verification loop, in addition to calling `validateUserOp`, the `handleOps` execution also must check that the paymaster is staked, and also has enough ETH deposited with the entry point to pay for the operation, and then call `validatePaymasterUserOp` on the paymaster to verify that the paymaster is willing to pay for the operation. Note that in this case, the `validateUserOp` is called with a `missingWalletFunds` of 0 to reflect that the wallet's deposit is not used for payment for this userOp.

During the execution loop, the `handleOps` execution must call `postOp` on the paymaster after making the main execution call. It must guarantee the execution of `postOp`, by making the main execution inside an inner call context, and if the inner call context reverts attempting to call `postOp` again in an outer call context.

Maliciously crafted paymasters _can_ DoS the system. To prevent this, we use a paymaster reputation system; see the [reputation, throttling and banning section](#reputation-scoring-and-throttlingbanning-for-paymasters) for details.

The paymaster interface is as follows:

```c++
function validatePaymasterUserOp
    (UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 requestId, uint256 maxCost)
    external returns (bytes memory context, uint256 deadline);

function postOp
    (PostOpMode mode, bytes calldata context, uint256 actualGasCost)
    external;

enum PostOpMode {
    opSucceeded, // user op succeeded
    opReverted, // user op reverted. still has to pay for gas.
    postOpReverted // user op succeeded, but caused postOp to revert
}
```


```c++
// add a paymaster stake (must be called by the paymaster)
function addStake(uint32 _unstakeDelaySec) external payable

// unlock the stake (must wait unstakeDelay before can withdraw)
function unlockStake() external

// withdraw the unlocked stake
function withdrawStake(address payable withdrawAddress) external
```

The paymaster must also have a deposit, which the entry point will charge UserOperation costs from.  The entry point must implement the following interface to allow paymasters (and optionally wallets) manage their deposit:

```c++
// return the deposit of an account
function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256)

// add to the deposit of the given account
function depositTo(address account) public payable

// withdraw from the deposit
function withdrawTo(address payable withdrawAddress, uint256 withdrawAmount) external

```

### Client behavior upon receiving a UserOperation

When a client receives a `UserOperation`, it must first run some basic sanity checks, namely that:

- Either the `sender` is an existing contract, or the `initCode` is not empty (but not both)
- The `verificationGasLimit` is sufficiently low (`<= MAX_VERIFICATION_GAS`) and the `preVerificationGas` is sufficiently high (enough to pay for the calldata gas cost of serializing the `UserOperation` plus `PRE_VERIFICATION_OVERHEAD_GAS`)
- The paymaster is either the zero address or is a contract which (i) currently has nonempty code on chain, (ii) has registered with sufficient stake value, (iii) has a sufficient deposit to pay for the UserOperation, and (v) is not currently banned.
- The callgas is at least the cost of a `CALL` with non-zero value.
- The `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` are above a configurable minimum value that the client is willing to accept. At the minimum, they are sufficiently high to be included with the current `block.basefee`.
- The sender doesn't have another `UserOperation` already present in the pool (or it replaces an existing entry with the same sender and nonce, with a higher `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and an equally increased `maxFeePerGas`). Only one `UserOperation` per sender may be included in a single batch.

If the `UserOperation` object passes these sanity checks, the client must next run the first op simulation, and if the simulation succeeds, the client must add the op to the pool. A second simulation must also happen during bundling to make sure that the storage accessed is the same as the `accessList` that was saved during the initial simulation.

### Simulation

#### Rationale

In order to add a UserOperation into the mempool (and later to add it into a bundle) we need to "simulate" it make sure it is valid, and that it is capable of paying for its own execution.
In addition, we need to verify that the same will hold true when executed on-chain.
For this purpose, a UserOperation is not allowed to access any information that might change between simulation and execution, such as current block time, number, hash etc.
In addition, a UserOperation is only allowed to access data related to this sender address: Multiple UserOperations should not access the same storage, so that it is impossible to invalidate a large number of UserOperations with a single state change.

#### Specification
To simulate a `UserOperation` validation, the client makes a view call to `simulateValidation(userop)`, with a "from" address set to all-zeros

This method always revert with `SimulationResult` as successful response.
If the call reverts with other error, the client rejects this `userOp`.

The simulated call performs the full validation, by  
calling:
1. `wallet.validateUserOp`.
2. if specified a paymaster: `paymaster.validatePaymasterUserOp`.

Either `validateUserOp` or `validatePaymasterUserOp` may return a "deadline", which is the latest timestamp that this UserOperation is valid on-chain.
the simulateValidation call returns the minimum of those deadlines.
A node MAY drop a UserOperation if the deadline is too soon (e.g. wouldn't make it to the next block)

The operations differ in their opcode banning policy.
In order to distinguish between them, there is a call to the NUMBER opcode (`block.number`), used as a delimiter between the validation functions.
While simulating `userOp` validation, the client should make sure that:

1. Neither call's execution trace invokes any **forbidden opcodes**
2. Must not use GAS opcode (unless followed immediately by one of { `CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `CALLCODE`, `STATICCALL` }.)
3. The first (validateUserOp) call is allowed to access storage slot of the wallet itself (see Storage access by Slots, below),
   but only on contracts that are not part of the current bundle (that is, not in a paymaster or any other wallet)
   Note that the wallet is allowed (and expected) to deposit to its own balance in the EntryPoint. That is allowed by this rule.
4. The second (validatePaymasterUserOp), the paymaster may access storage slots of itself AND of the wallet, above.
5. Limitation on "CALL" opcodes (`CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `CALLCODE`, `STATICCALL`):
   1. must not use value (except from wallet to the entrypoint)
   2. must not revert with out-of-gas
   3. destination address must have code (EXTCODESIZE>0)
6. `EXTCODEHASH` of every address accessed (by any opcode) does not change between first and second simulations of the op.
7. If `op.initcode.length != 0` , allow only one `CREATE2` opcode call (in the validateUserOp block), otherwise forbid `CREATE2`.

#### Storage access by slots

During validation, a contract `A` may reference storage of
1. Slots of contract `A` address itself. 
2. Slot `A` on any other address. 
3. Slots of type `keccak256(A || X)` on any other address. (to cover `mapping(address => value)`, which is usually used for balance in ERC20 tokens). 
4. Slots of type `keccak256(X || OWN)` on any other address, where OWN is some slot of the previous (third) type, or recursively of this (forth) type
  (to cover `mapping(address ⇒ mapping(address ⇒ uint256)`) that are usually used for `allowances` in ERC20 tokens).

#### Alternative Mempools

The simulation rules above are strict and prevent the ability of paymasters and signature aggregators to grief the system.
However, there might be use-cases where specific paymasters (and signature aggregators) can be validated
(through manual auditing) and verified that they cannot cause any problem, while still require relaxing of the opcode rules.
A bundler cannot simply "whitelist" request from a specific paymaster: if that paymaster is not accepted by all
bundlers, then its support will be sporadic at best.
Instead, we introduce the term "alternate mempool".
UserOperations that use  whitelisted paymasters (or signature aggregators) are put into a separate mempool.
Only bundlers that support this whitelist will use UserOperations from this mempool.
These UserOperations can be bundled together with UserOperations from the main mempool

### Bundling

During bundling, the client should:
- Exclude UserOps that access any sender address created by another UserOp on the same batch (via CREATE2 factory).
- For each paymaster used in the batch, keep track of the balance while adding UserOps. Ensure that it has sufficient deposit to pay for all the UserOps that use it.
- Sort UserOps by aggregator, to create the lists of UserOps-per-aggregator.
- For each aggregator, run the aggregator-specific code to create aggregated signature, and update the UserOps

After creating the batch, before including the transaction in a block, the client should:
- Run `eth_estimateGas` with maximum possible gas, to verify the entire `handleOps` batch transaction, and use the estimated gas for the actual transaction execution.
- If the call reverted, check the `FailedOp` event. A `FailedOp` during `handleOps` simulation is an unexpected event since it was supposed to be caught by the single-UserOperation simulation. Remove the failed op that caused the revert from the batch and drop from the mempool. Other ops from the same paymaster should be removed from the current batch, but kept in the mempool. Repeat until `eth_estimateGas` succeeds.

In practice, restrictions (2) and (3) basically mean that the only external accesses that the wallet and the paymaster can make are reading code of other contracts if their code is guaranteed to be immutable (eg. this is useful for calling or delegatecalling to libraries).

If any of the three conditions is violated, the client should reject the `op`. If both calls succeed (or, if `op.paymaster == ZERO_ADDRESS` and the first call succeeds)without violating the three conditions, the client should accept the op. On a bundler node, the storage keys accessed by both calls must be saved as the `accessList` of the `UserOperation`

When a bundler includes a bundle in a block it must ensure that earlier transactions in the block don't make any UserOperation fail. It should either use access lists to prevent conflicts, or place the bundle as the first transaction in the block.

#### Forbidden opcodes

The forbidden opcodes are to be forbidden when `depth > 2` (i.e. when it is the wallet, paymaster, or other contracts called by them that are being executed). They are: `GASPRICE`, `GASLIMIT`, `DIFFICULTY`, `TIMESTAMP`, `BASEFEE`, `BLOCKHASH`, `NUMBER`, `SELFBALANCE`, `BALANCE`, `ORIGIN`, `GAS`, `CREATE`, `COINBASE`. They should only be forbidden during verification, not execution. These opcodes are forbidden because their outputs may differ between simulation and execution, so simulation of calls using these opcodes does not reliably tell what would happen if these calls are later done on-chain.

Exceptions to the forbidden opcodes:
1. A single `CREATE2` is allowed if `op.initcode.length != 0` and must result in the deployment of a previously-undeployed `UserOperation.sender`.
2. `GAS` is allowed if followed immediately by one of { `CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `CALLCODE`, `STATICCALL` }.
   (that is, making calls is allowed, using `gasleft()` or `gas` opcode directly is forbidden)

### Reputation scoring and throttling/banning for paymasters
#### Rationale

Paymasters might influence many UserOperations in the mempool.
To prevent abuse, we throttle down (or completely ban for a period of time) a paymaster that causes invalidation of large number of UserOperations in the mempool.
To prevent paymasters from "sybil-attack", we require a paymaster to stake with the system, and thus make such DoS attack very expensive.
Note that this stake is never slashed, and can be withdrawn any time (after unstake delay)

The stake value is not enforced on-chain, but specifically by each node while simulating a transaction.
The stake is expected to be above PAYMASTER_MIN_STAKE_VALUE, and unstake delay above PAYMASTER_MIN_UNSTAKE_DELAY
The value of PAYMASTER_MIN_UNSTAKE_DELAY is 84600 (one day)

The value of PAYMASTER_MIN_STAKE_VALUE is determined per chain, TBD

#### Specification

Clients maintain two mappings with a value for each paymaster:

* `opsSeen: Map[Address, int]`
* `opsIncluded: Map[Address, int]`

When the client learns of a new `paymaster`, it sets `opsSeen[paymaster] = 0` and `opsIncluded[paymaster] = 0` .

The client sets `opsSeen[paymaster] +=1` each time it adds an op with that `paymaster` to the `UserOperationPool`, and the client sets `opsIncluded[paymaster] += 1` each time an op that was in the `UserOperationPool` is included on-chain.

Every hour, the client sets `opsSeen[paymaster] -= opsSeen[paymaster] // 24` and `opsIncluded[paymaster] -= opsIncluded[paymaster] // 24` for all paymasters (so both values are 24-hour exponential moving averages).

We define the **status** of a paymaster as follows:

```python
OK, THROTTLED, BANNED = 0, 1, 2

def status(paymaster: Address,
           opsSeen: Map[Address, int],
           opsIncluded: Map[Address, int]):
    if paymaster not in opsSeen:
        return OK
    min_expected_included = opsSeen[paymaster] // MIN_INCLUSION_RATE_DENOMINATOR
    if min_expected_included <= opsIncluded[paymaster] + THROTTLING_SLACK:
        return OK
    elif min_expected_included <= opsIncluded[paymaster] + BAN_SLACK:
        return THROTTLED
    else:
        return BANNED
```

Stated in simpler terms, we expect at least `1 / MIN_INCLUSION_RATE_DENOMINATOR` of all ops seen on the network to get included. If a paymaster falls too far behind this minimum, the paymaster gets **throttled** (meaning, the client does not accept ops from that paymaster if there is already an op from that paymaster, and an op only stays in the pool for 10 blocks), If the paymaster falls even further behind, it gets **banned**. Throttling and banning naturally reverse over time because of the exponential-moving-average rule.

**Non-bundling clients and bundlers should use different settings for the above params**:

| Param | Client setting | Bundler setting |
| - | - | - |
| `MIN_INCLUSION_RATE_DENOMINATOR` | 100 | 10 |
| `THROTTLING_SLACK` | 10 | 10 |
| `BAN_SLACK` | 50 | 50 |

To help make sense of these params, note that a malicious paymaster can at most cause the network (only the p2p network, not the blockchain) to process `BAN_SLACK * MIN_INCLUSION_RATE_DENOMINATOR / 24` non-paying ops per hour.

### RPC methods

`eth_sendUserOperation`

eth_sendUserOperation submits a User Operation object to the User Operation pool of the client. An entryPoint address `MUST` be specified, and the client `MUST` only simulate and submit the User Operation through the specified entryPoint.

The result `SHOULD` be set to true if and only if the request passed simulation and was accepted in the client's User Operation pool. If the validation, simulation, or User Operation pool inclusion fails, `result` `SHOULD NOT` be returned. Rather, the client `SHOULD` return the failure reason.

```json=
# Request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendUserOperation",
  "params": [
    {
      sender, // address
      nonce, // uint256
      initCode, // bytes
      callData, // bytes
      callGasLimit, // uint256
      verificationGasLimit, // uint256
      preVerificationGas, // uint256
      maxFeePerGas, // uint256
      maxPriorityFeePerGas, // uint256
      paymasterAndData, // bytes
      signature // bytes
    },
    entryPoint // address
  ]
}

# Response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": true
}
```

`eth_supportedEntryPoints`

eth_supportedEntryPoints returns an array of the entryPoint addresses supported by the client. The first element of the array `SHOULD` be the entryPoint addressed preferred by the client.

```json=
# Request
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_supportedEntryPoints",
  "params": []
}

# Response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": [
    "0xcd01C8aa8995A59eB7B2627E69b40e0524B5ecf8",
    "0x7A0A0d159218E6a2f407B99173A2b12A6DDfC2a6"
  ]
}
```

## Rationale

The main challenge with a purely smart contract wallet based account abstraction system is DoS safety: how can a miner including an operation make sure that it will actually pay fees, without having to first execute the entire operation? Requiring the miner to execute the entire operation opens a DoS attack vector, as an attacker could easily send many operations that pretend to pay a fee but then revert at the last moment after a long execution. Similarly, to prevent attackers from cheaply clogging the mempool, nodes in the P2P network need to check if an operation will pay a fee before they are willing to forward it.

In this proposal, we expect wallets to have a `validateUserOp` method that takes as input a `UserOperation`, and verify the signature and pay the fee. This method is required to be almost-pure: it is only allowed to access the storage of the wallet itself, cannot use environment opcodes (eg. `TIMESTAMP`), and can only edit the storage of the wallet, and can also send out ETH (needed to pay the entry point). The method is gas-limited by the `verificationGasLimit` of the `UserOperation`; nodes can choose to reject operations whose `verificationGasLimit` is too high. These restrictions allow miners and network nodes to simulate the verification step locally, and be confident that the result will match the result when the operation actually gets included into a block.

The entry point-based approach allows for a clean separation between verification and execution, and keeps wallets' logic simple. The alternative would be to require wallets to follow a template where they first self-call to verify and then self-call to execute (so that the execution is sandboxed and cannot cause the fee payment to revert); template-based approaches were rejected due to being harder to implement, as existing code compilation and verification tooling is not designed around template verification.

### Paymasters

Paymasters facilitate transaction sponsorship, allowing third-party-designed mechanisms to pay for transactions. Many of these mechanisms _could_ be done by having the paymaster wrap a `UserOperation` with their own, but there are some important fundamental limitations to that approach:

* No possibility for "passive" paymasters (eg. that accept fees in some ERC-20 token at an exchange rate pulled from an on-chain DEX)
* Paymasters run the risk of getting griefed, as users could send ops that appear to pay the paymaster but then change their behavior after a block

The paymaster scheme allows a contract to passively pay on users' behalf under arbitrary conditions. It even allows ERC-20 token paymasters to secure a guarantee that they would only need to pay if the user pays them: the paymaster contract can check that there is sufficient approved ERC-20 balance in the `validatePaymasterUserOp` method, and then extract it with `transferFrom` in the `postOp` call; if the op itself transfers out or de-approves too much of the ERC-20s, the inner `postOp` will fail and revert the execution and the outer `postOp` can extract payment (note that because of storage access restrictions the ERC-20 would need to be a wrapper defined within the paymaster itself).

### First-time wallet creation

It is an important design goal of this proposal to replicate the key property of EOAs that users do not need to perform some custom action or rely on an existing user to create their wallet; they can simply generate an address locally and immediately start accepting funds.

The wallet creation itself is done by a "factory" contract, with wallet-specific data.
The factory is expected to use CREATE2 (not CREATE) to create the wallet, so that the order of creation of wallets doesn't interfere with the generated addresses.
The `initCode` field (if non-zero length) is parsed as a 20-byte address, followed by "calldata" to pass to this address.
This method call is expected to create a wallet and return its address.
If the factory does use CREATE2 or some other deterministic method to create the wallet, it's expected to return the wallet address even if the wallet has already been created.  This is to make it easier for clients to query the address without knowing if the wallet has already been deployed, by simulating a call to `entryPoint.getSenderAddress()`, which calls the factory under the hood.
When `initCode` is specified, if either the `sender` address points to an existing contract, or (after calling the initCode) the `sender` address still does not exist,
then the operation is aborted.
The `initCode` MUST NOT be called directly from the entryPoint, but from another address.
The contract created by this factory method should accept a call to `validateUserOp` to validate the UserOp's signature.
For security reasons, it is important that the generated contract address will depend on the initial signature.
This way, even if someone can create a wallet at that address, he can't set different credentials to control it.

NOTE: In order for the wallet to determine the "counterfactual" address of the wallet (prior its creation), 
it should make a static call to the `entryPoint.getSenderAddress()`

### Entry point upgrading

Wallets are encouraged to be DELEGATECALL forwarding contracts for gas efficiency and to allow wallet upgradability. The wallet code is expected to hard-code the entry point into their code for gas efficiency. If a new entry point is introduced, whether to add new functionality, improve gas efficiency, or fix a critical security bug, users can self-call to replace their wallet's code address with a new code address containing code that points to a new entry point. During an upgrade process, it's expected that two mempools will run in parallel.

## Backwards Compatibility

This ERC does not change the consensus layer, so there are no backwards compatibility issues for Ethereum as a whole. Unfortunately it is not easily compatible with pre-ERC-4337 wallets, because those wallets do not have a `validateUserOp` function. If the wallet has a function for authorizing a trusted op submitter, then this could be fixed by creating an ERC-4337-compatible wallet that re-implements the verification logic as a wrapper and setting it to be the original wallet's trusted op submitter.

## Security considerations

The entry point contract will need to be very heavily audited and formally verified, because it will serve as a central trust point for _all_ ERC 4337 wallets. In total, this architecture reduces auditing and formal verification load for the ecosystem, because the amount of work that individual _wallets_ have to do becomes much smaller (they need only verify the `validateUserOp` function and its "check signature, increment nonce and pay fees" logic) and check that other functions are `msg.sender == ENTRY_POINT` gated (perhaps also allowing `msg.sender == self`), but it is nevertheless the case that this is done precisely by concentrating security risk in the entry point contract that needs to be verified to be very robust.

Verification would need to cover two primary claims (not including claims needed to protect paymasters, and claims needed to establish p2p-level DoS resistance):

* **Safety against arbitrary hijacking**: The entry point only calls a wallet generically if `validateUserOp` to that specific wallet has passed (and with `op.calldata` equal to the generic call's calldata)
* **Safety against fee draining**: If the entry point calls `validateUserOp` and passes, it also must make the generic call with calldata equal to `op.calldata`
