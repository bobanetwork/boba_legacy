Very close to being a normal proxy but has added\n functions `setCode` and `setStorage` for changing the code or storage of the contract. Nifty!\n Note for future developers: do NOT make anything in this contract 'public' unless you know what\n you're doing. Anything public can potentially have a function signature that conflicts with a\n signature attached to the implementation contract. Public functions SHOULD always have the\n 'proxyCallIfNotOwner' modifier unless there's some *really* good reason not to have that\n modifier. And there almost certainly is not a good reason to not have that modifier. Beware!"

Caller can only ever be the zero address if this function is\n being called off-chain via eth_call, which is totally fine and can be convenient for\n client-side tooling. Avoids situations where the proxy and implementation share a sighash\n and the proxy function ends up being called instead of the implementation one.\n Note: msg.sender == address(0) can ONLY be triggered off-chain via eth_call. If there's a\n way for someone to send a transaction with msg.sender == address(0) in any real context then\n we have much bigger problems. Primary reason to include this additional allowed sender is\n because the owner address can be changed dynamically and we do not want clients to have to\n keep track of the current owner in order to make an eth_call that doesn't trigger the\n proxied contract."
