# Bridging basics

Although Boba Network is an L2 (and therefore fundamentally connected to Ethereum), it's also a separate blockchain system. App developers commonly need to move data and assets between Boba Network and Ethereum. We call the process of moving data and assets between the two networks "bridging".

## Sending tokens betwen L1 and L2

For the most common usecase, moving tokens around, we've created the Standard Token Bridge. The Standard Token Bridge is a simple smart contract with all the functionality you need to move tokens between Boba Network and Ethereum.

Beside the Standard Token Bridge, we created the Fast Token Bridge to allow you to exit assets from L2 in serval hours or even serval minutes based on the number of transactions. The Fast Token Bridge collects a certain percentage of the deposit amount as the transaction fee and distributes them to the liquidity providers.
