### Testnet Fountain for Developers on Bobabase L2

There is a Bobabase testnet [fountain](https://gateway.bobabase.boba.network) for `BOBA`. Authentication is via Twitter - please go to the gateway and connect your MetaMask wallet to the Bobabase L2. In **gateway > wallet**, you will see the `Developer Twitter/Turing test token fountain`. This system uses Turing hybrid compute to interact with Twitter.

### Bridging

The standard bridges for `GLMR` (aka `DEV` on Moonbase) and `BOBA` are active, so you can can both bridge and exit `GLMR` and `BOBA` from Moonbase to Bobabase and back. The exit delay (the fraud proof window) has been set to 5 minutes (it's normally 7 days) to make development easier.

### Analytics and eth\_getLogs for Bobabase

If you have unusual `getLogs` needs, especially calls from `0 to latest`, the main RPC will block you, since this is how most DoS attacks work. In those cases, we encourage you to run your own RPC endpoint on your own replica of Bobabase. We have prepared Docker images for you, so this should only take a few minutes. To access these images:

* clone the `boba` repo
* switch to `alt-l1` branch.
*   Add `.env` in [boba-node](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/tree/alt-l1/boba\_community/boba-node) folder

    ```
    RELEASE_VERSION=v0.X.X
    ```

The bobabase's docker-compose file is in [`boba-community/boba-node/docker-compose-bobabase.yml`](https://github.com/bobanetwork/boba/tree/alt-l1/boba\_community/boba-node)

```bash
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-bobabase.yml pull
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-bobabase.yml up
```

The DTL will first sync with the chain. During the sync, you will see the DTL and Replica gradually catch up with the Boba L2. This can take several minutes to several hours, depending on which chain you are replicating.

### Bobabase Addresses
